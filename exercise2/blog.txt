REPORT

- Problems found during the exercise:
We only found a problem performing the task 7, while defining server function in case of reactive expressions. However, the explanation in tutorials is very simple and clear.
We were able to fix our problem.

- Personal comments and reviews:
We are able to explore the full application development path from problem presentation and conceptual design, through coding UI.R and server.R
The various building blocks available for constructing a UI are listed. We are able to use various widgets such as radio buttons, check boxes and sliders, to build the app.
If you are a data scientist without web development skils, and you have already been using R for data analyses, Shiny Server is a fantastic new package that will enable you
to quickly put together great looking web dashboards.

- Estimate time required to complete the exercise:
It took us approximately one week to complete the assignment.
